// XNL Future Technologies R36 Linux Partition Sizer
// =========================================================================================================================
// Purpose: This program is basically an (EXTREMELY xD) over-engineered tool to simply modify the file expandtoexfat.sh
// and change a simple numeric value in it and then saving it again with UTF-8 format. Nothing which could not easily be
// done with Notepad++, I just wanted to make a small program for this to make it easier for my community to set a custom
// Linux/ArkOS partition size.
//
// At the same time I wanted to take this oppertunity to make a small C# program with LOTS of comments in it so beginners
// might learn a something from it on how I did things and why I did certain things.
//
// For those who might be wondering why I'm using .NET Framework 4.7.2, firstly because it does the job which
// it needs to do well enough ;), and secondly because I'm trying to keep my applications as compatible as much
// with other operating systems, try to minimize runtime requirements AND because I want my applications to
// be able to run on Microsoft Surfare RT tablets which have Windows RT 10 (ARM32) running on them when possible ;)

// License:   Source code is only intended for educational purposes and to give people
//            the ability to 'take a look' what this application is doing. It CAN be used
//            to learn from and use snippets to make (a different) program from them for yourself and
//            also for public release, but it's not allowed to modify this program and then re-release
//            it as an alternative version (more explained on why bellow)
//            for the full license please visit the website of this project/program (listed above)
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Reason why I don't allow alternative versions of this program in the license:
// Because like stated at the top already: It's just an over-engineered tool which basically (in the end)
// does nothing more than just changing one numeric value in a text file (.sh actually).
// And I don't see any need why this needs to be forked and re-published/released dozens of times when
// this program just does what it needs to do.
//
// Q: So I can't adapt it so that it also works for my device (which uses different files and such)?
// A: NO, because that would defeat the whole purpose of my application which makes it super clear that
//    it's intended for the R36S and R36H (and most likely also usable for the RG351MP). If there would
//    be dozens of variations of my program with just minor changes in the code and some slight graphical
//    adjustments it would only clutter the internet with dozens of variations and cause confusion, or it
//    will result in lots of repositories which are all at a different version, alternative version etc
//    without being transparant about WHAT has changed or not compared to the orignal
//    (which happens more than enough already these days in my opinion).
//
// Q: But what if I COMPLETELY re-do the UI, make sure there is no confusion with this version etc?
// A: IF it is indeed for a completely different device which would otherwise not be supported by my
//    version (also not when holding shift while starting the application), AND you are going to re-do
//    the application UI, make your own icons/images, remove my logo/branding from it etc, THEN it
//    won't be a problem. That would be an exception to the license limitation(s) for the source code.
//    HOWEVER, you are then still required to include credits in your source-code, your version has
//    has to be SHARE-A-LIKE (and thus also be published WITH open-source), and the compiled version
//    will need to include credits to this version and a link to the website of this version (the teamxnl.com page)
//    in for example the about screen (for example something like: Based on the XNL R36 Linux Partition Sizer).
//
//    But in my honest opinion? Just don't clutter the internet with yet another version of this program and
//    instead just make your own version which is specifically designed for your device(s) inspired on/by this one :)
//
// I know, usually I'm less "troublesome" with my releases, and allowing re-releases, but this tool would just cause
// cluttering and confussion if it gets re-released a dozen times with the same layout, function etc.
// Hope you'll understand and respect this, thank you :)

This source code is NOT intended to be forked, re-distributed or to be used for "slightly alternative versions". It is intended for edcuational purposes, to give you the oppertunity to look at what my application is doing, or to use (parts of) it to make your own version of a program like this from scratch. The reason for this simply put is that this tool doesn't do 'that much of a special thing', it simply puts just edits one plain-text-script (sh), and changes one value in it. And that "proccess" just has been given a "nice jacket" for users to make that process a bit more streamlined for beginners. I just want to prevent that the internet gets cluttered with dozens of forks of this program with either just small to even no modifications. Resulting in nothing more than dozens of out-dated versions in the end, and thus regular users possibly getting confused on which version they will need or not (and that would defeat the entire purpose of this application ðŸ˜‰). And considering that the "thing" this application does is basically ridicilously simple, it's just useless to have a bucket full of forks from this repository on GitHibðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚  
  
The entire explanation, license etc can be found on the official website of the XNL R36 Linux Partition Sizer: https://www.teamxnl.com/r36-linux-partition-sizer/, There (and in the source code comments) you'll also find information on how/when you are allowed to (re-)use this source code for your own version ðŸ˜Š  
  
I hope that you'll understand and respect my decission to release the source-code with these limitations.
